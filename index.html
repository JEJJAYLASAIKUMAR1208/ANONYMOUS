  <h1>Introduction to Cybersecurity</h1>
  
  <p >In this module, learners are introduced to the field of cybersecurity. They gain an understanding of the importance of cybersecurity in protecting digital assets and information. Topics covered include the basics of cybersecurity, common threats and vulnerabilities, security policies and best practices, and an overview of the different areas of cybersecurity.</p>

<h1>Network Security</h1>
<p>This module focuses on network security, which involves securing networks and network infrastructure from unauthorized access, attacks, and data breaches. Learners explore concepts such as network architecture, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, virtual private networks (VPNs), and secure network protocols. They also learn about network security monitoring and incident detection techniques.</p>
<h1>Web Application Security</h1>
<p>Web application security is a critical aspect of cybersecurity, and this module delves into it. Learners gain an understanding of the vulnerabilities and risks associated with web applications and explore techniques to secure them. Topics covered include secure coding practices, input validation, session management, authentication and authorization mechanisms, and common web application security attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.</p>
<h1>Web Application Security</h1>
<h1>Cryptography</h1>
<p>Cryptography is the practice of secure communication and data protection. In this module, learners are introduced to the fundamentals of cryptography, encryption algorithms, symmetric and asymmetric encryption, digital signatures, and cryptographic protocols. They also learn about cryptographic key management, secure key exchange, and cryptographic best practices.</p>
<h1>Incident Response</h1>
<p>Incident response focuses on effectively responding to and managing cybersecurity incidents and breaches. Learners explore the stages of incident response, including preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery. They learn about incident response frameworks, incident handling procedures, and techniques for investigating and mitigating cybersecurity incidents. The module also covers incident reporting and documentation.

  These modules provide learners with a comprehensive introduction to key areas of cybersecurity, equipping them with foundational knowledge and skills necessary for understanding and addressing cybersecurity challenges in various domains.</p>
